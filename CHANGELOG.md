# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added owner-only public dashboard defaults so saved sources and visibility apply at clean owner URLs.
- Added a close button to the dashboard settings panel.
- Kept the dashboard timestamp compact and moved cache/quota details into an accessible tooltip.
- Exposed GitHub API quota source, remaining calls, and reset time in dashboard cache status.
- Reduced GitHub API fanout with GraphQL repository metadata, KV-backed repo fragments, and Durable Object rebuild locking.
- Made repository language tags clickable filters and exposed language filters in the command palette.
- Added a dedicated loading state while empty dashboards are still being fetched and cached.
- Improved account dropdown menu vertical alignment and item spacing.
- Replaced GitHub Pages deploys with automatic Cloudflare Worker deploys and live asset smoke checks.
- Added URL-restored dashboard view state for search, filters, sort order, and dev columns.
- Added a `need attention` dashboard filter for hot and busy repositories, with the metric tile acting as a shortcut.
- Migrated the app shell to Svelte/Vite with keyboard-accessible account dropdowns, a Cmd-K command palette, and tighter ReleaseBar-themed controls.
- Hardened GitHub auth, cache, and rate-limit handling with validated API payloads, cached installation tokens, scoped visibility settings, and PR commit linting.
- Raised owner dashboard builds from 8 to 200 public released repositories and made capped dashboards show the cap size.
- Filtered GitHub App selected repositories to public repos before auth state, coverage checks, or dashboards can use them.
- Fixed GitHub App install redirects to use the real `releasebar-app` app slug while keeping `release.bar` OAuth callbacks.
- Changed the root dashboard to `ReleaseBar Hot`, built from cached public dashboards instead of the maintainer snapshot.
- Replaced raw GitHub rate-limit failures with dashboard-shaped quota guidance.
- Changed the canonical public domain to `release.bar` and renamed the public dashboard to ReleaseBar.

- Moved GitHub login state into a top-right account menu with settings and logout actions.
- Added GitHub App login endpoints and settings UI state for signed-in users and app installation.

- Added route-aware owner dashboards, local visibility settings, and a cached Worker API for generic public GitHub dashboards.
- Added favicon and social preview card assets.
- Prevented cached dashboard data from showing archived repositories.
